        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Thom Castermans. Starting September 2015 I am working as a PhD student at the <a href="http://tue.nl/">TU&nbsp;Eindhoven</a>, after having finished my Master Computer Science &amp; Engineering in August 2015.</p>

        <p>Next to being a PhD, I work at <a href="http://www.juistdit.nl/">JuistdIT</a>, an IT company where I do both backend and frontend (web)development. Keywords/abbreviations that apply are PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, Scrum, Java and apps. While doing that, I try to help my younger/less experienced collegues when they have problems with web standards and the implementations of browsers thereof, or programming in general.</p>

        <p>Because I spend a lot of my time in front of computers, I think that it is very important to be outside in my spare time. Some exercise is healthy and otherwise, I get rusty. This is why I regularly go <b>running</b> and every week I participate in <b>survivalrun training</b> (which basically is running with obstacles, or, in other words, a playground for grown-ups). In summer you could spot me somewhere on a mountain while I am <b>hiking</b>. Unfortunately, that does require me to go abroad.</p>
