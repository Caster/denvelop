    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Thom Castermans. Currently I am studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering, a master program at the <a href="http://tue.nl/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>. I am in the final stages of that program and not sure what I will be doing after that yet.</p>

    <p>At this moment, I work at <a href="http://www.juistdit.nl/">JuistdIT</a>, a small IT company where I do both back end and front end work, but mostly front end. Apart from that, I try to help my younger and less experienced colleagues in their struggle with web standards and coding in general.</p>
