        <h1>VALA 2016</h1>
        <p>Between 2016-01-29 and 2016-02-14, I am away. Where? You can find
that on this page. What am I doing? That too you can find on this page. I will
not have internet access continuously, but I will write regular updates &mdash;
think once a day.</p>
        <p>You should read this page as a report of my trip in chronological
order from top to bottom. That means that here, at the top of the page, is stuff
I wrote before the trip. That includes this paragraph by the way. Scrolling
down, you will find notes of me describing my experiences during the trip. I
might post some sort of wrap up at the end.</p>

        <h1>What? Why?</h1>
        <p>From 9 to 11 February 2016, the biannual VALA conference will be held
in Melbourne. I will be visiting the conference and give a talk, together with
two fellow researchers. Of course, this is a good opportunity to see something
of Australia, so I will be doing that too. Also, because of a happy coincidence
with a KLM sale, I am traveling via Tokyo.</p>
        <p class="quote">I will experience a culture shock.</p>
        <p>This will be the first time I visit Asia. It will also technically be
the second, but practically be the first time I visit Australia. The first time,
I was only 10 months old, so that does not count.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page left">
        <h1>With whom?</h1>
        <p>With <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~kverbeek/">him</a>. And <a
href="http://www.axiom.humanities.uva.nl/arianna/">her</a>. It is related to <a

        <p>We will be giving another talk for people from <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a>, the national library of Australia. We are there anyway, right? This talk will be given in Canberra, meaning that the following flight is added to the timeline.</p>

        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #2</span>time to board</h1>
        <p>People are gathering at the gate. In three quarters of an hour, the
plane to Tokyo will take off. This is a sneak peak of Tokyo: being surrounded by
Japanese tourists. It is actually rather stereotypical, most of them are
carrying big cameras and snapping pictures of everything.</p>
        <p>The plane is called Albert Plesman. I hope Albert has comfortable
seating and that I can get some sleep. We will see. I will write another update
from Tokyo, possibly only in the evening, from the hotel. That is, the evening
in Tokyo of course.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #3</span>...morning! *yawn*</h1>
        <p>So, I obviously did not manage to write a blog post in the evening.
Why not? Well, because I am a sleepyhead. Me and Kevin knew we had to stay up
late, at least, we felt like that, to adjust somewhat to the timezone. This
means that when we were riding the metro, where it was warm, we both needed to
work really hard to stay awake. We managed to do that and got back to our hotel
around 21:00 I think. It did not take long for me to get ready for bed and
sleep. I was expecting to wake up early, but I did not: it is now a quarter to
nine in the morning.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of things I can and should write about. Let me first
get dressed and all that though and maybe have breakfast. We'll see.</p>
        <p>P.S. Look on the right: I have been there, woot! I have taken more
pictures too. Stay tuned!</p>

        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #4</span>First day in Tokyo</h1>
        <p>While I am writing this, it is the start of my second day here in
Tokyo. I was promised a culture shock and yep, I got one. Things are different
over here. People are different, buildings are different, texts, roads, signs,
everything. I think I like it so far. Japan seems to be weird in a good way.</p>
        <p>First of all, people are extremely polite. As far as I can tell (but
don't quote me on this), thank you is 'arigato' and thank you very much is
'arigato go sai mas'. The latter is also used when talking to someone who is
socially superior to yourself (yes, that is a thing in Japan). Now obviously, I
do not speak Japanese nor do I understand it. But when I listen to for example
the stewardess in the plane or the (automated) updates in the metro, all I hear
is 'mas'. When you bump into people, they will bow and say sorry a thousand
times. In fact, I have started bowing too. When you see everyone around you do
it, you have to yourself. Also, Japanese people tend to be little, so bowing is
sometimes literally needed. I have crashed into the braces in the metro a couple
of times already. When I walked into the men's room on Narita airport, I thought
that they had urinals for children. Turns out that that height is simply normal
here. I have seen little buses driving around that emphasize this, I will see
if I can snap a picture of one of those today. They feature cats on the outside.
</p>
        <p>Secondly, the view is completely different from Europe. Apart from
the fact that cars drive on the left here (and you have to walk on the left too,
which is confusing at times), architecture is completely different.</p>
        <p>But more on that later. I just found out that my laptop charger does
not fit in the universal socket I have with me, so I will need to look for
another one: my battery is about to die. Luckily, my phone charger does fit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page left">
        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #5</span>Charged!</h1>
        <p>This is yet another day later, I am starting to build up a backlog.
Kevin luckily had bought sockets in which my laptop charger does fit. It is too
fat. Anyway, it provides my laptop with juice again, so that is good.</p>
        <p>My first day in Tokyo started in the morning by arriving at Narita
airport, the international airport quite close to Tokyo. I am actually not sure
where Tokyo starts or ends, so it may be in Tokyo, or neighbouring it. In any
case, getting to the centre of Tokyo (or is it the centre? At least the central
station) takes about an hour by train. After getting my luggage and going
through customs (we had to fill in annoying forms on the plane), this was one of
the first obstacles: getting a train ticket.</p>
        <p>Step one is getting money. In Japan, it is apparently still the norm
to pay cash. Some places even explicitly mention that they do not accept credit
cards. In the Netherlands, we of course have the PIN system, I am not sure if
they have something comparable here. At any rate, the ATM at the airport did not
accept my Dutch PIN card. Annoyingly I went through all the steps, punched my
code, selected an amount, et cetera and only at the last step did it say that it
did not accept the card. I even got a receipt that had stars for everything,
including the amount. Luckily, all went well when I used my credit card.</p>
        <p>The ATM had mentioned that it only had 10.000¬• bills. No, I did not
make a typo there. No, the dot is not a decimal separator. Japanese yen (yens?)
are simply worth slightly less than euros. At this moment, one euro equals
approximately 128 yen. This I like, because 128 is a power of two. The clever
thing is that there is no need for cents: one yen is the unit for everything,
period. There are 1¬•, 2¬•, 5¬•, 10¬•, 50¬•, 100¬•, 500¬• coins and then 1.000¬•,
2.000¬•, 5.000¬• and 10.000¬• bills. The 5¬• and 50¬• coins are funny, because they
are more or less the same as the 10¬• and 100¬• coins respectively, only with a
hole punched in them. Thus, a coin with a hole is worth half the value of the
similar coin without a hole. It also actually mentions the amount, so the coins
are not completely the same. That would be too confusing, even for Japanese
standards.</p>
        <p>When we had cash, we had to get a train ticket. This was not too
hard, they are used to foreigners at the airport, so the lady behind the desk
could easily help us. We also wanted to be able to travel by metro easily, which
in our case means getting a PASMO card. This is actually the best choice for
most tourists. It is basically an <i>OV-chipkaart</i> for the metro: you can
charge money on it and then check in and check out to use it. Very handy indeed!
The card could be bought at a machine that made funny noises. I soon figured out
that many things in Japan do that.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have to cut this update short again, because we are
moving out to do more stuff today. I suppose that I am going to write a lot
either tonight, or tomorrow during the flight to Melbourne. <i>Say≈çnara!</i></p>

        <p>Finally, it is time to write about the places I visited on my first
day in Tokyo. After we boarded the train at Narita airport, I had the time to
slowly adjust to the Japanese environment. This includes, but is absolutely not
limited to: funny music that is played when the train/metro doors are about to
close (every station has a different tune), bowing people everywhere, (too)
colorful commercials/banners, to me unreadable characters and small
everything.</p>
        <p>There is a sort of smooth transition from farmland around Narita to
the huge city that Tokyo is. When we got there, we went to our hotel to drop off
our luggage. The hotel staff was more than friendly, of course. After that, we
continued our journey to Shibuya, a neighorhood, I would say <i>(<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo">Wikipedia
disagrees</a>)</i>, of Tokyo. In Shibuya, we entered the most pink and fluffy
candyshop I have ever seen. We could taste one piece of candy and it was strange
and good. I have absolutely no idea what it was though. Note that that will be
recurring theme.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="page right">
        <p>We then continued towards the Meiji shrine, which is situated in the
Yoyogi park, close to the oddly-shaped Yoyogi national stadium. Don't get me
wrong, it is a beautiful building. We entered the park, an oasis of calm and
peace in the huge, chaotic metropolis that Tokyo is. The park has wide lanes,
beautiful lanterns, many <i>Torii</i> gates, banners and other nice little
things. In the center of the park, one can find the Meiji shrine. This is a quite
large temple complex, where many rituals can be observed and executed. Let me
explain my interpretation of a couple of them (I actually did it myself and
nobody said I did something wrong, which can mean that either I did everything
correctly, or people thought it would be rude to point out my failure).</p>
        <p>The first ritual is the clensing or purification. Before entering a
temple, you can cleanse your hands and mouth. This can be done at a fountain
close to the temple entrance. In fact, most temples I have seen feature such a
fountain. The fountains I have seen are always covered by a roof. There is a,
well, a fountain with a bunch of ladles lying on top. The clensing ritual goes
as follows.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill the ladle with water.</li>
            <li>Pour water over your left hand (not in the fountain, but next to
it).</li>
            <li>Repeat over your right hand.</li>
            <li>Pour water in your cupped left hand, put it in your mouth and
spit that next to the fountain. You should not drink directly from the
ladle!</li>
            <li>Hold up the ladle straight with both hands and let the remaining
water drop out of it, over the handle of the ladle and your hands. This looks
silly, just so you know.</li>
            <li>Put the ladle back. Congratulations, you are now cleansed!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Another ritual I have witnessed and executed is praying. There is
always a wooden box in which coins can be tossed. Generally, it is advisable to,
out of respect, throw a coin in the box and pray a short prayer. At the Meiji
shrine, we saw people (and did ourselves) do the following.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Throw coin in box.</li>
            <li>Ring bell if present (not applicable at Meiji).</li>
            <li>Bow twice.</li>
            <li>Clap twice.</li>
            <li>One more deep bow.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I am pretty sure that you do the praying (or making a wish, what you
prefer) after the bowing and before the clapping. A final remark about temples
in Japan: I noticed that people tend to bow in the direction of the temple when
they leave the area, that is, when they pass the (last) Torii gate.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p>After the Yoyogi park and Meiji shrine visit, we took the metro to
Asakusa. This is, like Shibuya, a neighborhood or district of Tokyo. It features
the Kaminarimon (a beautiful gate), Sens≈ç-ji temple and Nakamise and
Shin-Nakamise shopping street. We strolled around, tried a couple of local
snacks, looked at interesting products that are being sold there (like katanas),
had dinner at a very Japanese restaurant and then had ice cream with relaxing
video game-like background music before going back to the hotel.</p>

        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #7</span>Kamakura</h1>
        <p>The second day in Tokyo, me and Kevin went on a day trip to Kamakura.
This is a little town to the South of Tokyo, close the coast. One can reach it
from the heart of Tokyo by train/metro in a little less than an hour, which is
exactly what we did. The reason that Kamakura is interesting to go to on a day
trip, is that hundreds of years ago, around the end of the thirteenth century,
it was for a short while the capital of Japan. This was apparently a chaotic
period, where <i>shoguns</i>, the leaders at the time, ruled for a very short
period of time before being killed. Anyway, they attracted Zen monks from China
because they believed, like the Zen monks, that one should focus on one thing.
The shogus focused on fighting, the monks on meditating, but apparently that
worked for them. Also, I believe that the monks were persecuted in China, but I
am not sure about that. The monks built a lot of temples, statues and other
beautiful stuff in Kamakura. Some of it was lost in fires and other disasters,
but much has been rebuilt too. At present, it is simply a very nice sight. There
is a lot of nature, which is a nice contrast to Tokyo. Those monks know what a
nice environment is!</p>

        <p>We visited a number of temples. The first one we visited is very
close to the Kita-Kamakura station and is called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engaku-ji">Engaku-ji</a>. There is a huge
gate (two storeys tall), a temple building with a dragon painted on the ceiling,
gardens that looked nice even now, in winter and many smaller buildings. Some
are dojos, where for example lessons in mediation can be taken, still today
even. Others are houses: apparently, people live on the temple grounds. We even
spotted a school, but admittely we had started walking into a Japanese
neighborhood at that moment. For some reason, it is possible to get from the
temple grounds (where you have to pay a fee to enter) to the houses and back
without anyone checking on you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page left">
        <p>After that, we walked a short distance to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkei-ji">T≈çkei-ji</a> temple. This
temple is situated in a valley, surrounded by trees and lots of flowers. We
visited in the wrong season, obviously, but we were lucky in the sense that some
flowers were starting to blossom. We both were able to take a couple of nice
pictures. For many temples, there is a centerpiece, in a way, of a pond with a
bridge crossing it. I am not exactly sure what the meaning behind that is, but
it can look very nice. Unfortunately, the pond at T≈çkei-ji was a bit dry &mdash;
it looks better in summer. There was a second, smaller one however, with a nice
atmosphere. Finally, towards the hills that define the valley, we actually ran
into a cemetry. Japanese graves are very creative, you will not find two similar
toombs.</p>

        <p>After finding out that the Japanese characters for <i>exit</i> are
'chandelier' followed by a square (we call it 'q.e.d.', because it is the symbol
that is being used at the end of a proof), we walked over to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dchi-ji">J≈çchi-ji</a>, another temple
in the same valley. Because of time constraints, we walked passed it however.
What I could see over the wall was beautiful though. We followed a path along
the temple grounds, that meanders up the hills, passes a couple of shrines and
eventually ends at the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dtoku-in"><i>Daibutsu</i></a> of
Kamakura. A daibutsu is a huge statue of Buddha, in this case it is more than 13
metres tall.</p>

        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #9</span>Kamakura continued</h1>
        <p>So, there has been a delay, but I can finally write another update.
Let me continue where I left of. The Daibutsu hiking course travels past a
couple of interesting shrines, that we of course visited. They are the
following.</p>
        <p>After some searching, we found the somewhat hidden entrance to a cave
shrine dedicated to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeniarai_Benzaiten_Ugafuku_Shrine">Zeniarai
Benten</a>. As one might expect, it is a cave, but it is actually paved inside
to form a sort of tunnel. This tunnel ends in a small valley, where a couple of
temples are built. One of them has a pond with a bridge to a shrine next to it.
People were praying at the shrine, as described before. The pond houses quite a
few carpers, that usually hang around near the bridge. Protip: you can lure the
carpers by rubbing your thumb and index finger together above the water; they
will think you are putting food in the water. <i>Blup. Bluuup.</i></p>
        <p>The actual cave shrine is located further back in the valley, in a
proper cave. The godess Benten is known as <i>Money-Washing Benten</i> and there
is a belief that washing your money will bring you luck and fortune. To this
end, small rush baskets and puddles are provided close to a pool of water in the
cave. We saw people washing their bills and coins, but we did not dare throwing
our bills in the water. In the back of the cave we saw a pile of little wooden
Torii gates. We did unfortunately not figure out what the ritual for that is, or
what the purpose of putting the gates there is. It definitely does look
impressive!</p>
        <p>The second shrine along the hiking course is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_Inari_Shrine">Sasuke Inari-jinja</a>.
This shrine is dedicated to the god of harvests, who has a fox as a messenger.
Consequently, you will find statues of little foxes everywhere. And I mean
everywhere. Along the path to the shrine, that is almost completely covered by
Torii gates, you will find statues of foxes looking at you. They wear red things
that look like bibs, I have admittely no idea what that is for, but it looks
nice.</p>

        <p>When we continued the hike, dusk started to settle. We rushed
downhill towards Kamakura and the Daibutsu, but already knew that we were on the
late side. Temples tend to close early. Eventually, we came to a closed gate.
That is right, we did not see the buddha... At least we tried. Maybe next
time?</p>

        <p>We did have dinner at a very Japanese restaurant though. The
specialty is eel and I have to say that it was really good. Also, when we left
we got a <i>presento</i> (I love the way the Japanese speak English): a little
notebook. Very cute.</p>

        <p>In the evening, we went to an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya"><i>Izakaya</i></a> where we had a
drink or two and also some snacks. Please do not think of chips or nuts now.
Think sausages, squid and dumplings. We drank <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju"><i>Soju</i></a> of sweet potatoes and
rice. We even had a <a

not something I drink every day. I can recommend it.</p>

miscellaneous</h1>
        <p>After all the strange stuff we had already seen, it was time for something more normal. Just kidding of course. The ??? temple is a small shrine in the middle of a neighborhood. It is centered around <i>maneki neko</i> or beckoning cats. These are the famous Japanese little statues of cats with one paw in the air, sometimes waving at you. They are meant to bring luck and fortune into shops. </p>

        <p>And just like that, after a ten hour flight, I was in Melbourne,
Australia. We should have been leaving at 12:15 and arriving at 00:10, but the
flight was delayed by more than four hours, apparently because of technical
issues with another plane some time earlier that were still festering around. As
a compensation, Jetstar provided us with a 1000¬• coupon each, to be used at any
place in the food court. The coupon had to be spent, apparently, at one place,
but luckily we were two and so we could have dumplings at one place and
chocolate cake at another. Yum.</p>
        <p>The flight was not so good. No one to blame really, but I could not
really sleep at all. This meant that I arrived at Melbourne Airport around five
in the morning, which is not a good time to arrive anyway, without having slept
really. After being allowed access to the country (Australia is pretty strict,
so I was happy with that), I could pass on to the luggage retrieval and hall.
Note that you have to fill in forms on the plane and that you are not allowed to
bring any food into the country. They even ask if you have mud under your shoes,
because there could be diseases in there, I guess.</p>
        <p>Anyway, Kevin and I got a cab and asked to be brought to the airport
lodge. We thought that we would be able to clearly communicate with everybody
now that we were in an English-speaking country, but that was a mistake. The cab
driver was hard to understand, at best. Unfortunately, that was not his only
problem. He clearly did not like the fact that we were asking him to do a ten
minute drive (which is obviously better than an hourlong walk). Apart from that,
he was not very good at driving, or so it seemed. He appeared to be in love with
the brake, because he repeatedly stamped it down, only to aggressively
accelerate afterwards again. I never knew it was possible to have a bumpy ride
on a flat road. He did bring us to the hotel (and charged A$20 while the meter
said A$16.9, "because of airport"), where we found another pleasant surprise: no
WiFi in the room. Kevin inquired at the lobby, where the receptionist dryly
concluded that "it must not reach your room then". Our room was about ten metres
away from the lobby by the way. Although the room was somewhat disappointing
too, we slept well because of our lack of sleep.</p>
        <p>The next morning, we were brought to the airport by a shuttle bus
from the hotel. From there, we caught a bus downtown. This is really great;
there are busses going every ten minutes pretty much all day long. It is a short
walk from the Southern Cross station, where we were dropped off, to our hotel.
The Mercure hotel is really good so far. It was great to finally have a shower
after the long flight.</p>

        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #10</span>Melbourne</h1>
        <p>We discovered a bit of downtown Melbourne and quickly concluded that
it is <s>a bit of</s> a hipster city. There are bars, restaurants, eateries,
gelaterias (<i>gelaterie</i>) everywhere. Just see for yourself on <a
href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/search/food/@-37.8158338,144.955559,15z?hl=
nl">Google Maps</a>. Furthermore, many places are located in alleys (really
dodgy alleys someimes, which is a very strange experience) or on the second,
third or sixth floor of buildings. It is also possible that a combination
applies. Imagine a dodgy alley with a dodgy staircase. Graffiti and shadiness
are very common here. Then, when you go up the stairs, you will at some point
encounter an oasis of light, music and hipster happiness. Welcome to
Melbourne.</p>
        <p>I have to say that I do <s>secretly</s> really enjoy it.</p>
