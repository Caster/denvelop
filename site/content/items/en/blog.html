        <h1>VALA 2016</h1>
        <p>Between 2016-01-29 and 2016-02-14, I am away. Where? You can find
that on this page. What am I doing? That too you can find on this page. I will
not have internet access continuously, but I will write regular updates &mdash;
think once a day.</p>
        <p>You should read this page as a report of my trip in chronological
order from top to bottom. That means that here, at the top of the page, is stuff
I wrote before the trip. That includes this paragraph by the way. Scrolling
down, you will find notes of me describing my experiences during the trip. I
might post some sort of wrap up at the end.</p>

        <h1>What? Why?</h1>
        <p>From 9 to 11 February 2016, the biannual VALA conference will be held
in Melbourne. I will be visiting the conference and give a talk, together with
two fellow researchers. Of course, this is a good opportunity to see something
of Australia, so I will be doing that too. Also, because of a happy coincidence
with a KLM sale, I am traveling via Tokyo.</p>
        <p class="quote">I will experience a culture shock.</p>
        <p>This will be the first time I visit Asia. It will also technically be
the second, but practically be the first time I visit Australia. The first time,
I was only 10 months old, so that does not count.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page left">
        <h1>With whom?</h1>
        <p>With <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~kverbeek/">him</a>. And <a
href="http://www.axiom.humanities.uva.nl/arianna/">her</a>. It is related to <a
href="https://www.win.tue.nl/CatVis/">this project</a>, more specifically <a
href="http://www.vala.org.au/vala2016-proceedings/996-vala2016-session-8-betti">
this talk</a>. It is all rather technical, but the resulting pictures are nice.
You can find a couple of <a

        <p>We will be giving another talk for people from <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a>, the national library of Australia. We are there anyway, right? This talk will be given in Canberra, meaning that the following flight is added to the timeline.</p>

        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #2</span>time to board</h1>
        <p>People are gathering at the gate. In three quarters of an hour, the
plane to Tokyo will take off. This is a sneak peak of Tokyo: being surrounded by
Japanese tourists. It is actually rather stereotypical, most of them are
carrying big cameras and snapping pictures of everything.</p>
        <p>The plane is called Albert Plesman. I hope Albert has comfortable
seating and that I can get some sleep. We will see. I will write another update
from Tokyo, possibly only in the evening, from the hotel. That is, the evening
in Tokyo of course.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <h1><span class="pre-title">Update #3</span>...morning! *yawn*</h1>
        <p>So, I obviously did not manage to write a blog post in the evening.
Why not? Well, because I am a sleepyhead. Me and Kevin knew we had to stay up
late, at least, we felt like that, to adjust somewhat to the timezone. This
means that when we were riding the metro, where it was warm, we both needed to
work really hard to stay awake. We managed to do that and got back to our hotel
around 21:00 I think. It did not take long for me to get ready for bed and
sleep. I was expecting to wake up early, but I did not: it is now a quarter to
nine in the morning.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of things I can and should write about. Let me first
get dressed and all that though and maybe have breakfast. We'll see.</p>
        <p>P.S. Look on the right: I have been there, woot! I have taken more
pictures too. Stay tuned!</p>
